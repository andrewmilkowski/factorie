/** For storing one of the proposals considered.
    "diff" is the list of changes represented by this Proposal.
    "modelScore" is the difference in score after-before, according to the model.
    "objectiveScore" is the difference in score after-before, according to the objective function.
    "acceptanceScore" is the score that will be used to accept/rank/select among multiple proposals.  It is typically the modelScore multiplied by a temperature.
    Note that objectiveScore may not be truly set, in which case it will have value Math.NaN_DOUBLE. */
