// Notes on class names for Variables:
// Except for cc.factorie.Variable, "*Variable" means mutable
// "*Observation" always means immutable, and mixes in trait ConstantValue
// "*Value" is agnostic about whether it is mutable or not.  Hence "IntValue"
//  Note that in the language of probability theory "value" refers not to the "random variable", but the values it takes on.
//  The way to think about this is that FACTORIE "*Values" are never instantiated on their own;
//  The instantiation reads something like "Variable with IntValue"


/**Abstract superclass of all variables.  Don't need to know its value type to use it. 
   The trait is abstract because you should not instantiate this trait directly, only subclasses.
   <p>
   You should never make a Variable a Scala 'case class' because then it will get hashCode and equals methods
   dependent on its constructor arguments; but the FACTORIE library depends on being able to distinguish individual
   Variable instances based on their address.
